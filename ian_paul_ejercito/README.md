# Javascript Challenge v.1.3.0

Included in this repository is a blank HTML file containing the list of items stored in the *info* variable. This is a sample data that you might get when you are requesting data from a REST API endpoint.

Using the provided HTML file, please create a mobile web prototype that will list *ALL* the items separated by category. Please see the wireframe as a guide (wireframe.png). 

### Regarding the Wireframe:
Please note that this is just a "wireframe" and we would expect you to apply some designs. Using Bootstrap or Foundation should suffice.

## Requirements:
* HTML5 and CSS3 required.
* Items should be dynamically added when the page loads.
* Please use Javascript only. We can reconsider jQuery... no other frameworks (ReactJS, AngularJS, Vue.js, etc...)

## Please answer the following questions:
* Please explain how did you come up with the solution. We would like to see your train of thought.
    Here are concepts that I have come up while creating this app
        -I used modular architecture approach based on JSON file provided.
        -I separate major functionalities and break it down into modules.
        -Each modules have functions in relation to the context of its module.
        -Variables/functions that does not need to be exposed globally are encapsulated in their module.
        -Modules are communicating each other through returned variables/functions.
        -This approach partially mimicks the MVC pattern of any popular framework.
    
    
* Please explain any design decisions made (why you chose the design/framework, etc.)
    I created a responsive page that is compatible both in desktop and mobile(kindly resize the page). I like the concept of simplicity without framework. 
    
    
* Please indicate tools that you used for coming up with your solution.

* Choose one: Star Wars or Star Trek? Why?
    I have to google this up since i'm not a fan of sci fi movie, neither I have watch both :). But going back to my instinct, I would choose star trek. I think star wars are more fun to watch but to understand it I need to watch star trek.
